2.	Agreement Structure.  
HCL America Inc. is the owner and/or licensor of the Intellectual Property Rights in the VoltMX Program. 
HCL Technologies Limited is the owner and/or licensor of all other Program(s) and all associated Intellectual 
Property Rights. HCL America Inc.  is a wholly owned subsidiary of HCL Technologies Limited. Licenses are 
granted and Support is obtained solely in connection with valid Orders. For Orders issued in the US, HCL 
America Inc.  shall be the billing entity for each VoltMX Program Order. HCL Technologies Limited shall be 
the billing entity for all other Orders. For the rest of the world the billing entity will be the HCLSoftware entity 
stated on the applicable Order.  Each Order is subject to the terms of this Agreement and any License 
Information Document, if applicable, and deemed to be a discrete contract, separate from each other Order, 
unless expressly stated otherwise therein.  Orders may be entered into under this Agreement by and between (a) 
HCLSoftware or an Affiliate of HCLSoftware; and (b) the Licensee or an Affiliate of Licensee.  With respect to 
an Order, the term HCLSoftware or Licensee (or Customer) will be deemed to refer to the entities that execute 
such Order.  Neither execution of this Agreement nor anything contained herein will obligate either Party to 
enter into any Orders.  In the event an Order is proposed by HCLSoftware, and is deemed to constitute an offer, 
then acceptance of such offer is limited to its terms.  As also set forth in Section 1.12 (Order) hereof, in the 
event Licensee proposes or accepts an Order by submitting a Licensee purchase order, order document, 
acknowledgment, or other Licensee communication, then regardless of whether HCLSoftware acknowledges, 
accepts, fully or partially performs under any such document, HCLSoftware objects to and rejects any 
additional or different terms in such document and no such additional or different terms will become part of the 
agreement between the Parties even if HCLSoftware uses or refers to such document for invoicing purposes.

3.	License Grant
3.1	Subject to the terms, conditions, and other restrictions set forth in this Agreement, and a valid Order 
(including timely payments of any Fees therein), HCLSoftware grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, non-
transferable, limited, and revocable license, without the right to sublicense, under HCLSoftware IPR, to 
install, access, and use the Programs (i) in the Territory (ii) up to the Licensed Capacity; (iii) only for 
Licensee’s internal business purposes); (iv) for the term stated in the applicable Order; and (v) in 
accordance with the Documentation, License Information Document and the applicable Order.  For 
avoidance of doubt, Licensee has no rights to create derivative works, assign, distribute, lease, rent, or 
otherwise transfer the Program(s).
3.2	Licensee Affiliates and Authorized Users may install, access, and use the Programs and Support under the 
terms of this Agreement, and such use shall be counted in determining Licensee’s utilization of the 
Licensed Capacity. Licensee shall remain fully responsible for ensuring its Affiliates’ and Authorized 
Users’ agreement and compliance with the terms of this Agreement and the Order.
3.3	HCLSoftware may, in its sole discretion, make available pre-release, alpha or beta versions of the Program, 
pre-release, alpha or beta Program features and/or pre-release, alpha or beta Program code that are not 
generally available to date (hereinafter referred to as the “Pre-release Program”). HCLSoftware does not 
guarantee that the generally available release will be identical to the Pre-release Program or that the 
generally available release will not require reinstallation. Licensee agrees that if it registers for Support or if 
otherwise required by HCLSoftware, Licensee shall provide HCLSoftware with specific information 
concerning Licensee’s experiences with the operation of the Pre-Release Program.  Licensee agrees and 
acknowledges that the Pre-release Program (a) is to be used only for testing purposes and not to perform 
any production activities unless HCLSoftware shall have otherwise approved in writing and (b) has not 
been tested or debugged and is experimental and that the documentation may be in draft form and will, in 
many cases, be incomplete.  Licensee agrees that HCLSoftware makes no representations regarding the 
completeness, accuracy or Licensee’s use or operation of the Pre-Release Program.  PRE-RELEASE 
PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT ANY INDEMNITY, WARRANTY 
OR REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING WITHOUT 
LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, 
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR PURPOSE AS WELL AS ANY EXPRESS WARRANTIES 
PROVIDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS AGREEMENT. If Licensee is also a tester of the Pre-release 
Program (as defined by the pre-release testing agreement (“Pre-Release Agreement”) that was agreed to by 
Licensee during the registration process before obtaining the Pre-release Program), Licensee agrees that the 
terms of this Agreement are in addition to, and do not supersede, the terms of the Pre-Release Agreement.
3.4	 If the Program is being licensed on a trial, demonstration or evaluation basis, Licensee agrees to use the 
Program solely for such purposes, in accordance with the usage restrictions set forth in Section 4, for the 
evaluation period defined in the applicable Order or trial document (the "Trial Period").  At the end of the 
Trial Period, Licensee’s right to use the Program automatically expires and Licensee agrees to de-install the 
Program and return to HCLSoftware all copies or partial copies of the Program or certify to HCLSoftware 
in writing that all copies or partial copies of the Program have been deleted from Licensee’s computer 
libraries and/or storage devices and destroyed.  If Licensee desires to continue its use of the Program 
beyond the Trial Period, Licensee may contact HCLSoftware or an HCLSoftware Affiliate to acquire a 
license to the Program for the applicable fee.  LICENSEE’S USE OF THE PROGRAM DURING THE 
TRIAL PERIOD IS ON AN "AS IS" BASIS WITHOUT ANY INDEMNITY, WARRANTY OR 
REPRESENTATION OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, 
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR PURPOSE, AS WELL AS ANY EXPRESS WARRANTIES 
PROVIDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS AGREEMENT. 
3.5	Licensee hereby acknowledges that the Program(s) may contain Third Party Software and/or Open Source 
Software and/or may require Program Requirements.  In the event that Open Source or Third Party 
Software is included in the Program(s), such Open Source or Third Party Software is made available to 
Licensee in accordance with the licenses for such Open Source or Third Party Software. In the event that 
the Program relies on Program Requirements and unless expressly provided otherwise in an Order, 
Licensee agrees that: (a) HCLSoftware and its Affiliates have not obtained or conveyed to Licensee any 
Intellectual Property Rights to use the applicable Program Requirements; (b) Licensee shall be solely 
responsible, at its cost and expense, for procuring the required rights/licenses in the Program Requirements; 
(c) HCLSoftware does not provide any warranties or support for Program Requirements; and (d) any claims 
with respect to the Program Requirements shall be made against the applicable third party provider of such 
Program Requirements.
4.	License Restrictions

provides Feedback to HCLSoftware, Licensee hereby grants to HCLSoftware a worldwide, non-exclusive, 
perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, under any and all Licensee IPR in and 
to the Feedback to make, use, sell, offer to sell, have made, import, reproduce, prepare derivative works, 
distribute, incorporate or otherwise utilize such Feedback.

8.	Support and Updates
Support services (“Support”) are provided by HCLSoftware as described in the current support guide (“Support 
Guide”) posted at https://support.hcltechsw.com/csm. Upon purchase of a license for the Program(s), Licensee

additional cost. While HCLSoftware Support is in effect, HCLSoftware may make available defect corrections, 
restrictions, bypasses, new versions, releases, or updates available as part of Support.  Any items provided 
under Support are subject to the same terms, conditions, usage limitations and restrictions as the Program 
originally licensed to Licensee by HCLSoftware and any applicable License Information Document.
9.	Licensee Data and Privacy
9.1	HCLSoftware as controller.  Licensee authorizes HCLSoftware and its Affiliates to store and use Licensee's 
business contact information wherever it does business, in connection with Licensee’s use of HCLSoftware 
Programs and related services or Support, or in furtherance of HCLSoftware's business relationship with 
Licensee. Any personal data used by HCLSoftware as a data controller will  be processed under the terms of the 
HCLSoftware online privacy statement found here: https://www.hcltechsw.com/wps/portal/legal/privacy. 
9.2	Data excluding personal data. To assist Licensee in isolating the cause of an error or Problem with the 
Program(s), HCLSoftware may request that Licensee send certain information to HCLSoftware. Such 
information may include metadata, usage metrics, and/or system data, excluding personally identifiable 
information. Licensee acknowledges that HCLSoftware uses information about errors and problems to improve 
its products and services and to assist with its provision of related Support offerings. Licensee is responsible for 
ensuring that such data is backed up before providing same and that it is sent only through HCLSoftware 
approved secure channels. 
9.3	HCLSoftware as processor. To the extent Licensee provides personally identifiable information to 
HCLSoftware for purposes of using the Program, or for receiving Support or related services (including 
information contained in a support ticket or file attachment), such information shall be processed by 
HCLSoftware as a data processor. The terms of the HCLSoftware data processing addendum (“DPA”) found at 
https://www.hcltechsw.com/wps/portal/resources/master-agreements posted as of the Effective Date shall apply 
to such processing and are hereby incorporated by reference. To the extent personal data from the European 
Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom and Switzerland are processed by HCLSoftware, the Standard 
Contractual Clauses shall apply, as further set forth in the DPA. For the purposes of the Standard Contractual 
Clauses, Licensee and its applicable Affiliates are each the data exporter, and Licensee’s acceptance of this 
Agreement shall be treated as its execution of the Standard Contractual Clauses and Appendices. Licensee 
acknowledges that it shall have no reason to provide sensitive personal data/special category of personal data to 
HCLSoftware for any purposes and shall not include same in any support ticket or file attachment without 
HCLSoftware’s prior express written consent. 
9.4	Protection of Licensee Data. HCLSoftware will maintain appropriate administrative, physical, and 
technical safeguards for protection of the security, confidentiality and integrity of Licensee data, as described in 
HCLSoftware’s Technical and Organizational Measures found here: https://www.hcltechsw.com/resources/sw-

10.	Payments.  
10.1. Fees.  Licensee will pay any and all Fees, without deduction, offset or withholding, as detailed in the 
Order. Except as provided therein, all amounts in the Order are in United States Dollars (USD). 
HCLSoftware will invoice Licensee annually in advance.  Licensee will pay HCLSoftware for the amounts 
due, owing, and duly invoiced under the Order within thirty (30) days of the date of invoice. Licensee shall 
make all payments pursuant to the Order through electronic transfer of funds to the designated bank 
accounts as nominated by HCLSoftware in writing. Overdue amounts payable under the Order will bear 
interest from the original due date at the rate of one percent (1%) per month or the maximum legal rate, 
whichever is less. Except as provided in this Agreement, all Fees are non-refundable and non-cancellable. 
If the Licensee has a bona fide dispute in respect of the whole or any part of any invoice, Licensee shall 
notify HCLSoftware in writing within ten (10) days of receipt of an invoice and, if a dispute remains 
unresolved within 10 days of receipt of notification, Licensee may withhold payment of the amount in 
dispute but shall pay the undisputed amount in accordance with this Agreement. If HCLSoftware 
subsequently determines any disputed amount is due from Licensee, or if the Parties resolve the payment 
dispute, the amount due shall be paid within 7 days after such determination or resolution.
10.2. Right to charge additional Fee. Where applicable, HCLSoftware reserves the right to charge, upon notice 
to the Licensee, additional fees if applicable for (i) over deployment as per Section 11; and (ii) re-
instatement fee for lapsed Support and/or other Program.
10.3. Taxes.  All Fees quoted are exclusive of taxes. Licensee is responsible for payment of any and all sales, 
use, value added, GST, and other similar taxes or governmental fees associated with the Order, except for 
taxes based on HCLSoftware’s net income, gross revenue or employment obligations. If HCLSoftware is 
obligated by applicable law to collect and remit any taxes or fees, the appropriate tax or fee amount will be 
charged and set forth in the applicable invoice. Licensee agrees to bear any withholding tax liability as may 
be required by applicable law and would increase payment due under the Order by such an amount so that 
the net payment made to HCLSoftware after deduction of applicable withholding tax is the same, had there 
been no withholding tax applicable. Licensee is solely responsible for timely and accurate payment of 
applicable taxes and fees without deduction from HCLSoftware’s invoiced amounts, irrespective of what 
HCLSoftware’s invoice may state. Subject to applicable laws and presentation of a valid tax exemption 
certificate provided within the period of the payment terms, HCLSoftware will make relevant adjustments 
in the invoice.  Licensee shall remain liable for any incorrect claims of tax exemptions.
11.	License Compliance.  Licensee agrees that HCLSoftware may, no more than one time per twelve (12) month 
period, audit the Licensee’s use of the Programs including but not limited to software logs of Licensee, its 
Affiliates and Authorized Users, relating to the Program in order to verify their use in compliance with this 
Agreement and/or the Order.  HCLSoftware may make copies of any such software logs to the extent 
necessary to verify Licensee’s compliance with the terms hereof.  HCLSoftware may at its option and cost, 
engage an independent third party to do such audit, provided that such third party is subject to confidentiality 
obligations consistent with this Agreement.  The audit may be conducted at any sites of Licensee’s Affiliates 
and Authorized Users, where the Program is installed, used or accessed from, including remotely.  
HCLSoftware will bear its own costs in connection with an audit. HCLSoftware will provide fifteen (15) 
calendar days’ notice prior to an audit.  Any such audit will be performed during the usual business hours of 
the Licensee, its Affiliates or Authorized Users and HCLSoftware will use commercially reasonable efforts to 
have the audit conducted in a manner that minimizes disruption to business.  Licensee, its Affiliates, and 
Authorized Users will provide all assistance reasonably necessary for HCLSoftware to carry out such audit.  If 
the audit reveals underpayments, including but not limited to any underpayments due to any usage of Programs 
other than as authorized in this Agreement, Licensee will promptly make such payments and in case of 
unauthorized usage, pay for the differentials at HCLSoftware’s then list price for the Program.  As with all 
provisions of this Agreement, HCLSoftware’s rights and remedies in this section will be without prejudice to 
other rights and remedies HCLSoftware has under this Agreement or in any Order, at law or in equity.  
HCLSoftware’s audit rights under this section will survive for two years beyond the longer of the term license 
on the Order, the relevant perpetual License or the Agreement.

13.	Confidentiality.  Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, both Parties will hold in 
confidence the Programs, Documentation and all other non-public or proprietary information or any other 
information that by its form, nature, content or mode of transmission would to a reasonable recipient be deemed 
confidential or proprietary as made available by the disclosing Party (“Confidential Information”).  Both 
Parties agree that the Programs and Documentation will be treated as proprietary trade secrets of HCLSoftware. 
Neither Party will make Confidential Information available in any form to any person or entity other than to its 
respective Affiliates and Licensee’s Authorized Users on a need to know basis and subject to the same 
restrictions of this Section 13. Recipients of Confidential Information that are not employees of either Party 
must be subject to confidentiality restrictions no less stringent than those contained herein (in the case of non-
employees such restrictions will be contained in a written agreement executed by the applicable 
contractor/person/entity).  Each Party warrants to the other Party that it maintains a system of confidentiality to 
protect its own Confidential Information, including written agreements with employees, that the Confidential 
Information will be protected by such system using no less than a reasonable degree of care, and that it shall 
ensure its recipients’ compliance with this Section. If the receiving Party at any time becomes aware of any 
unauthorized use or disclosure of the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, it will promptly and fully 
notify the disclosing Party of all facts known to it concerning such unauthorized use or disclosure and 
reasonably cooperate with the disclosing Party in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy to 
limit such disclosure.
14.	Performance Warranty.

Warranty”).
14.2. The Performance Warranty does not cover Problems, failures, or defects in the Programs caused by any act 
or omission of Licensee or its representatives, or any other non-HCLSoftware person or entity, including 
but not limited to: (a) the misuse of or damage to the Program; (b) modifications to the Programs not made 
by or as authorized in writing in advance by HCLSoftware; (c) combination or use of the Programs with 
other software, hardware or cloud infrastructure not provided by HCLSoftware; (d) use of the Program in 
an operating environment other than that described in the Documentation or Program Requirements 
mutually agreed in writing; or (e) failure to install updates, patches or fixes provided by HCLSoftware.  
14.3. THE LIMITED WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN SECTION 14.1 ABOVE ARE 
LICENSEE’S EXCLUSIVE WARRANTIES.  HCLSOFTWARE DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER

ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY 
QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND ANY WARRANTY OR 
CONDITION OF NON-INFRINGEMENT.  SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW 
THE EXCLUSION OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY 
NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE.  IN THAT EVENT, SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN 
DURATION TO THE RESPECTIVE WARRANTY PERIOD.  NO WARRANTIES APPLY AFTER THE 
WARRANTY PERIOD.  SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON 
HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY 
TO LICENSEE.
14.4. THE WARRANTIES IN THIS SECTION 14 ARE PROVIDED SOLELY BY THE HCLSOFTWARE 
ENTITY LICENSING THE PROGRAM AND NOT BY A THIRD PARTY OR ANY OTHER 
HCLSOFTWARE ENTITY.  THE DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION 14, HOWEVER, ALSO APPLY 
TO ALL HCLSOFTWARE ENTITIES AND THEIR LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS OF THIRD 
PARTY SOFTWARE. THOSE SUPPLIERS PROVIDE SUCH SOFTWARE WITHOUT WARRANTIES 
OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND.
14.5. Performance Warranty Remedy. In the event of breach of the above stated Performance Warranty, 
Licensee’s remedy is for HCLSoftware, in consultation with Licensee, to either (i) use reasonable efforts 
consistent with industry standards to repair the defect within a commercially reasonable time frame, (ii) 
replace the affected Program(s) with one that materially complies with the Documentation, or in the event

International Sale of Goods; or (iii) other international laws. Furthermore, all rights, duties, and 
obligations arising from, or relating in any manner to, the subject matter of this Agreement, are subject 
to the jurisdiction of the courts of the country in which Licensee obtained the Program license.
17.18. U.S. Government Restricted Rights.  The Programs and Documentation provided with the products 
and services are “commercial items” as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 12.101, consisting of

However, in the event Licensee purchased perpetual licenses for the Programs from a third party prior 
to the Effective Date, nothing herein shall modify Licensee’s rights to use the Programs under those 
license terms but HCLSoftware shall have the right to enforce its IPR in the Programs during and after 
the term hereof.
